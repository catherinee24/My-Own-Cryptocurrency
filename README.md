<h1>My own Cryptocurrency with python.</h1>
<p>Programming my own cryptocurrency with python, I wanted to put my theoretical knowledge into practice.</p>

<p>In the end, if you are training in blockchain, the most important thing, once you acquire the basic knowledge, be it in cryptography, be it in theoretical foundations, programming, creation of dapps or video games, in whatever field, it is always good to have awareness of how things are done in this technology.</p>

<p>Creating a cryptocurrency is quite complex, you have to be aware of the blockchain and understand the theoretical foundations of this topic, both the theory and the cryptographic foundations behind the technology. </p>

<p>What we will practice:

  - The basics of blockchain technology.
  - The basics of cryptography.
  - Cryptographic algorithms</p>

<p>So I hope you enjoy as much as I do creating a prototype of your own blockchain.</p>
